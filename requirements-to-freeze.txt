# This is the file to edit when you are adding dependencies.
# Run `./scripts/requirements/freeze_requirements.sh` after making changes to this file.
# A potential issue that can occur is that a library has a requirement that is
# on a different version than another requirements.txt somewhere, in which case, you
# need to update the lower version to match the higher version.

class AiExperimentsUpdateHandler(AiExperimentHandler, ExperimentsUpdateHandler):
  """Update an already existing AiExperiment.
    This takes an already existing AiExperiment and sets its new values. Only the values
    that need to be changed should be included in this object, not any existing and unchanged fields. Thus,
    any field not mentioned explicitly in this PUT schema can't be changed after the AiExperiment is created.
    This is conceptually more like a RESTful PATCH call, however for historical reasons we use the PUT verb instead.

    This is complicated by arrays of objects parameters and metrics. For those arrays you do need to
    include all of the previous and new objects, because we will remove any object that is not present in the array.
    For those objects all of the same rules as creation continue to apply.

class ClientsProjectsUpdateHandler(ProjectHandler):
  """Updates an existing project.
    This takes an already existing project and sets its new values. Only the values
    that need to be changed should be included in this object, not any existing and unchanged fields. Thus,
    any field not mentioned explicitly in this PUT schema can't be changed after the Project object is created.
    This is conceptually more like a RESTful PATCH call, however for historical reasons we use the PUT verb instead.
